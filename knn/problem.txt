You have a small garden with two types of flowers: Roses and Tulips. You've measured the petal length and petal width of some flowers and recorded their types. Now, you find a new flower and want to determine whether it's a Rose or a Tulip based on its petal length and width.

Petal Length (cm)	Petal Width (cm)	Flower Type
3	                1	                Rose
3.5	                1.2	                Rose
4	                1.5	                Rose
5	                2	                Tulip
5.5	                2.2	                Tulip
6	                2.5	                Tulip


And the new flower you found has:

Petal Length: 4.5 cm
Petal Width: 1.8 cm
