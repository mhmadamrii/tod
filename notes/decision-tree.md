## Decision Tree

A decision tree is like a flowchart that helps you make decisions by asking a series of questions. It’s a simple but powerful tool used in machine learning to predict outcomes based on input data

### Decision Tree Analogy:

- Imagine you’re trying to figure out what kind of fruit is in front of you. You might ask questions like:

1. Is it red?

   - if yes, it might be an apple
   - if no, ask another question

2. Is it round?

   - if yes, it might be an orange
   - if no, ask another question

3. Is it small?
   - if yes, it might be a cherry
   - If no, it might be a watermelon.

### Each question splits the problem into smaller parts, and eventually, you reach a conclusion (the fruit’s name). A decision tree works the same way, but it uses data instead of your intuition!

## How a Decision Tree Works:

1. Root Node: The first question (e.g., "Is it red?").

2. Branches: The possible answers to the question (e.g., "Yes" or "No").

3. Leaf Nodes: The final decision or prediction (e.g., "Apple" or "Orange").
